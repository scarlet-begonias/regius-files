* tenant service
Do we bootstrap the system with a known admin tenant and user, like Frevvo does?
- add tenant
  + must provide a tenant admin user id and password
- list tenants
- deactivate tenant

* privileges
- manage tenants: only available for users in admin tenant
- manage users: always only for the tenant this user belongs to

* users
- each user is scoped to a tenant (userid@tenant)

* privilege service
- allowed-p: given a user, an operation, and optionally a target object, is the operation allowed?

* user service
- add user
- list users
- modify user
- deactivate user
